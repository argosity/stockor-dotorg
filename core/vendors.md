**Vendors**  Companies you purchase stuff from.  A [Vendor](vendors) has both a shipments and payments [address](address), a [gl account](general-ledger) that payables should be applied against, and a payment term.

Stockor maintains a list of [SKUs](skus-and-locations) that can be purchased from a given [Vendor](vendors).

[Purchase Orders](purchase-orders) are placed with a vendor for goods that the company wishes to purchase.
