**Invoices**  constitute a demand for payment for goods that have been delivered to a [Customer](customers).

A invoice contains:

 * Customer contact information
 * An [inventory location](skus-and-locations) that goods will be taken from.
 * The customer provided Purchase Order Number
 * The [Payment Terms](payment-terms) that were extended.  This will control how much time the Customer has to pay the invoice in full.
 * One or more SKUs, the quantity desired for each and the selling price for them.

While an Invoice often originates with a [Sales Order](sales-orders), it does not have to.  Sales that take place in a retail environment where the customer selects the goods and pays for them immediately do not require a sales order record.  For instance, the Stockor Point of Sale iOS application does not generate Sales Orders.

Once an invoice is saved, it immediately removes the SKUs from the inventory location and generates corresponding [General Ledger](general-ledger) entries debiting the asset account and crediting the customers receivables account.

When payment is received against the Invoice, the receivables account is debited and the payments holding account is credited.
