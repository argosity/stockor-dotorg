**Payment Terms** are a record of when payment is required and any discounts that are offered.

A payment term encapsulates the number of days before payment is due, how payment is required to be made, and if a discount is offered for quicker payment.

Payment Terms are shared between [Vendors](vendors), [Customers](customers), [Purchase Orders](purchase-orders), and [Sales Orders](sales-orders).

Examples of a Payment Term would be:

 * **CASH**:  Payment is due immediately in cash (or equivalent)
 * **NET30**: One of the most popular terms, payment is due in full in 30 days.
 * **2P10NET30**: Payment is due within 30 days, but a discount of 2% is offered if paied within 10 days.
