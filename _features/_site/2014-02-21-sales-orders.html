<p><strong>Sales Orders</strong>  A Sales Order (often abbreviated as SO) is a record of a request by a <a href="customers">Customer</a> to purchase <a href="skus-and-locations">SKUs</a>.</p>

<p>It contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The customer’s contact information.  Stockor records both a billing and shipping <a href="addresses">Address</a>.</li>
  <li>An <a href="skus-and-locations">inventory location</a> that goods will be taken from.</li>
  <li>A Purchase Order Number (PONUM) that was provided by the customer.</li>
  <li><a href="payment-terms">Payment Terms</a> for the order.</li>
  <li>One or more SKUs, the quantity desired for each and the selling price for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The terms and addresses default to the values specified for the customer, but may be over-ridden on a per-order basis.</p>

<p>Like <a href="purchase-orders">Purchase Orders</a>, SO’s transition through a list of standard steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They begin as <em>Saved</em></li>
  <li>If the order needs to be picked from a warehouse, a Pick Ticket can be generated for the order.  The state will then be <em>Picking</em>.</li>
  <li>Once the order is ready for shipping, delivery, or is picked up, an <a href="invoices">Invoice</a> is generated.  The order will then be in the final state: <em>Invoiced</em></li>
</ul>
