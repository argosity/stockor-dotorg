<p><strong>Addresses</strong> are a basic building block of Stockor.  Most entities in the system have links to one or more of them.</p>

<p>They’re fairly basic and somewhat betray the USA centric origins of Stockor. It will need to be re-woreked if/when Stockor is used in other countries.  The good news is that it’s pretty segregated and upgrading just a few spots will fix it across the system.</p>

<p>An address tracks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A name</li>
  <li>A Phone Number</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Two lines for street address</li>
  <li>City, State, and postal code.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, all attributes may be left blank.  Different uses may require filling in some of the fields.  For instance a <a href="sales-orders">Sales Order</a> with a shipping method specified will require filling in the postal portions.</p>
