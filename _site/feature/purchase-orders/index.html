  <p><strong>Purchase Orders</strong>  A Purchase Order (often abbreviated as PO) is a record of a request to purchase a product from a Vendor.  It contains one or more SKUs, the quantity desired for each and the price offered for them.</p>

<p>A Purchase Order progresses through set stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It starts of as simply <em>Saved</em>  This state indicates that the PO has been saved but no further action has been under-taken.</li>
  <li>Once it has been sent to the <a href="vendors">Vendor</a>, it transitions to <em>Sent</em>.</li>
  <li>Once a confirmation has been received from the vendor it becomes <em>Confirmed</em>  At this point the PO may be considered a legal contract between the Company and the Vendor.</li>
  <li>Once the ordered <a href="skus-and-locations">SKUs</a> are received, the PO will be marked as either <em>Partial</em> or <em>Complete</em>.  A Voucher is  then created from the Purchase Order.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="vouchers">Vouchers</h5>

<p>A voucher is a record that the Company owes a vendor funds.  Like Purchase orders they transition through states; <em>Pending</em>, <em>Paid</em> and <em>In Dispute</em></p>
