      <hr>
  <p><strong>Payment Terms</strong> are a record of when payment is required and any discounts that are offered.</p>

<p>A payment term encapsulates the number of days before payment is due, how payment is required to be made, and if a discount is offered for quicker payment.</p>

<p>Payment Terms are shared between <a href="vendors">Vendors</a>, <a href="customers">Customers</a>, <a href="purchase-orders">Purchase Orders</a>, and <a href="sales-orders">Sales Orders</a>.</p>
