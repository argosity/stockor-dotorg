  <p>Companies (<em>or individuals</em>) you that purchase things from you.  A customer has both a shipments and payments address, a gl account that payments should be applied against, and a payment term.</p>

<p>Stockor maintains a list of logins that belong to a customer.</p>

<p>If goods are not received immediately by the customer, a Sales Order is entered into the system to record the sale for future fulfillment, and an Invoice is generated when the goods are delivered (<em>or shipped</em>).</p>

<p>If the customer takes immediate possession of the items, then only an Invoice is generated.  For instance the Point of Sale application only generates Invoices.</p>
