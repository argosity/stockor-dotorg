  <p><strong>Invoices</strong>  constitute a demand for payment for goods that have been delivered to a <a href="customers">Customer</a>.</p>

<p>A invoice contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customer contact information</li>
  <li>An <a href="skus-and-locations">inventory location</a> that goods will be taken from.</li>
  <li>The customer provided Purchase Order Number</li>
  <li>The <a href="payment-terms">Payment Terms</a> that were extended.  This will control how much time the Customer has to pay the invoice in full.</li>
  <li>One or more SKUs, the quantity desired for each and the selling price for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>While an Invoice often originates with a <a href="sales-orders">Sales Order</a>, it does not have to.  Sales that take place in a retail environment where the customer selects the goods and pays for them immediately do not require a sales order record.  For instance, the Stockor Point of Sale iOS application does not generate Sales Orders.</p>

<p>Once an invoice is saved, it immediately removes the SKUs from the inventory location and generates corresponding <a href="general-ledger">General Ledger</a> entries debiting the asset account and crediting the customers receivables account.</p>

<p>When payment is received against the Invoice, the receivables account is debited and the payments holding account is credited.</p>
