### About Stockor

Stockor was originally created by Rails consultancy, <a href="http://argosity.com/">Argosity</a> to assist it's sister company <a href="http://themedicslife.com/">The Medics Life</a> in selling online and managing it's inventory.

After a few years of successfully use, Argosity decided that it could be of use for other companies as well and created a software as a service (SaaS) version.

In order to gain wide-spread use, Argosity has now opened-sourced it.  We encourage contributions on <a href="https://github.com/argosity">our gihub site</a>.

In addition to the open-source version, Argosity continues to operate Stockor as a paid online service at <a href="http://stockor.com/">Stockor.com</a>
